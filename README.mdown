HAR
===

Ruby library to work with and view HTTP archives.
This includes [harviewer][viewer], which can be launched through the "har" command.

Install
=======

    gem install har

Viewer Setup
============

In this fork, the viewer is removed from the gem and loaded via bower. This works if you're willing to run `thor viewer:update` from the gem directory, but it seems like the wrong way to go for providing the harviewer dependency.

A better approach may be to make a harviewer Ruby port that includes the thor task and mirrors releases of the harviewer library.

Usage
=====

    HAR::Archive.from_string(json) #=> #<Har::Archive:0x5e7cac>
    HAR::Archive.from_file(path)   #=> #<Har::Archive:0x5e7cac>

Or launch a local [harviewer][viewer] the command line:

    har /path/to/some.har

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
=============================

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
